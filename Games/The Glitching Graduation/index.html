<h3><u>Concept</u></h3>
<p>This project was developed as a game for AdvXJam and the theme of this jam was "A Good Time." I collaborated with writers, sound designers + artists and we agreed to make a visual novel in Unity that would
   center on young adults going through a timeloop around their graduation day.</p>

<h3><u>Implementation</u></h3>
<p>We agreed to use Unity as the game engine and Pixel Crushers Dialogue System as the interactive dialogue tool because I had prior experience with it and I knew that if
   something were to go wrong during development, I could get it fixed since the tool has detailed documentation and excellent customer support. This was my first time
   using the Visual Novel framework, a visual novel template that is included with Dialogue System that comes with a main menu and a menu panel to easily allow saving and loading. </p>

<p>The default template comes with two subtitle panels to fit two character portraits but the Visual Novel framework is very customisable so I made the game to have five subtitle
   panels so it can fit all of the four character portraits and one invisible portrait for the narrator.</p>

<h3><u>Status of the game</u></h3>
<p>Right now, the game is 75% complete as it has a rushed ending so I could submit the game before the deadline. I aim to give the game a proper ending in the near future. You can
